# Reference implementation of the indy-agent

In order to run any of the reference implementations, you must have libindy built and have a running ledger.  If you are just trying it out, we recommend [running a ledger locally using docker](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/ubuntu-build.md).

See the README in each implementation directory for more specific details.
